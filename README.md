#Project Manager

TECHNOLOGIES USED: ReactJS and TailwindCSS.

This website application allows the user to create a list of projects and then be able to create a list of tasks associated with a given project. 
There is the ability to edit, delete, add, and complete items from each list; with an alert displaying confirmation of each action taken.

Future Updates/Considerations: 
1. Create login system
2. create progress bar for each project.
3. allow subtasks and subprojects to be added/edited/deleted/completed.
4. Add in due dates with alerts
